# StairNet Initiative
Repository for all projects related to the StairNet initiative.

The StairNet initiative was created to support the development of new deep learning models for visual sensing and perception of stair environments for human-robot walking. The initiative places emphasis on lightweight and efficient neural networks for onboard real-time deployment on mobile and embedded devices. The StairNet dataset, contains over 515,000 manually labeled images, supporting the development of next-generation environment-adaptive control systems for robotic leg prostheses, exoskeletons, and other assistive technologies for human locomotion.
